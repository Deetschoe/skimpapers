# Skim Papers

A single iOS app for finding and reading research papers. Search across arXiv, bioRxiv, PubMed, and other databases from one place.

Upload your own PDFs or books from the web app on your laptop. They sync to your phone and you can read them anywhere.

Highlight text, ask questions about what you're reading (the app has context over the full document), and get paper recommendations based on your interests.

That's it. One library, one reader, everything in one place.

Build for myself but other may enjoy, just dm me for access
